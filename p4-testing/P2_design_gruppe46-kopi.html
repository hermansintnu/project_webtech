      <h3>purpose and audience</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the project for Andres’ Bananas! food trucks, is to help Andrés business to grow
        by giving him a website that's gripping and clear. To promote his brand and provide possible
        customers with enough information to know what his food truck provides, its history
        and how to order food from his food truck. </p>
        <p>Therefore, this site will provide the user with a menu, an option for ordering food and
        the location of the food trucks. There will also be information about Colombian food and history.</p>
        <p> Seeing how there are two trucks, located at Gløshaugen and the second alternating between Kalvskinnet, Tunga and Dragvoll,
        the audience will mainly be students and employees of NTNU. </p>

      <h2>The Design</h2>

<!-- Navigation structure -->
      <div class="in_container">
        <h3>Navigation structure</h3>
        <p> It is possible to access every startingpage from all the pages through a navigation bar.
          This means they can access the menu, about us and location through a navigation bar.
          This is to give the user freedom to explore the website and always have an exit form the page they are on.  </p>

      <!-- Page layout and apperance -->

      <div class="in_container">
        <h3>Page layout and apperance</h3>
        <p> The idea is to have a Colombian inspired website through the use of traditional colombian colors i.e.
          the ones from the Colombian flag. The backgroundcolor is yellow and has the same RGB value as the yellow in
          the flag. The design will be simplistic so the user experience is simple and easy.

<!-- Minumum requirements -->

    <div class="in_container">
      <h3>Minimum requirements</h3>
      <p>The webiste will have four distinct javascript applications to fulfill the minumum requirements</p>
      <p>Pål and Herman will be in charge of implementing</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A javascript function that will update the position of the trucks depending on which day it is.
        Seeing how one of the trucks moves during the week it is important to always show its live position</li>
        <li>An overlay for the different dishes in the menu. When the user clicks on a dish an overlay
        will show with different options such as adding ingredients or choosing a vegetarian/vegan option.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Marius and Ståle will be in charge of implementing</p>
      <ol>
        <li>a timer that counts down after a user has ordered food. I.e. "the food will be done in "X-minutes""</li>
        <li>An a javascript function that keeps track of the dishes the user has chosen. After adding patacones
        to the cart, a dynamic overview of the users order will be displayed next to the menu. Here the users
        will have the option to add another or remove the order. </li>
