    <h1>Testing of the website</h1>

    <div class="in_container">
      <h2>Administrative details</h2>
      <p>The name of the fictional client is Andres' Bananas, and is the sole proprietor of Andres' Bananas foodtruck
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="in_container">
      <h2>Tester audience</h2>
      <p>Seeing that our intended audience is for students studying at Gløshaugen who need a little food. We went in the
        corridors and asked students if they had some time to spare to test out our webpage for a food
        ordering system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="in_container">
      <h2>Testing platforms</h2>

      <p>The testing platforms depended on situation, we had published the page on folk.ntnu and gave the link to
        students after asking if they would be willing to test out our page. This resulted in different operative
        systems(macOS and Windows) on different screensizes. The browsers were
        primaraly safari and google chrome in these cases. We also brought our own laptops and asked other students to
        test the website on those, where we had opened the
        page in opera and firefox. </p>

      <p>We had brought our own laptops, so that the students wouldn't have to hassle with getting up their own. <br>
        The platforms we tested on where a windows 16.8 inch, and a macbook 13inch in different browsers like chrome,
        opera, firefox and safari</p>

      <h2> Physical testing with observations</h2>

      <h3>Brage (MacOS 13inch, Safari):</h3>
      <p>Deilig homepage <br>

        First click: "Order now"<br>

        Second click: What does he want? Choses cheapest option.

        Small bug for choosing extra topping.<br>

        Easy to choose dishes, and go to paymant<br>

        Easy payment side, <br>

        Confirmation page is easy to understand<br>

        Checking around the rest of the page:<br>
        Location page: Works nicely. Doesn't go to check where the locations are despite it beeing an option on the
        homepage.
        Good that it shows on the order confirmation.<br>

        Suggestion: Could show the location on the payment side when choosing between gløshaugen or øya/kalvskinnet?
      </p>

      <h3>Gorgus (Windows 16.8inch, Firefox):</h3>
      <p>First impressions: good contrast on colors <br>

        First click: "About", likes that you can read the history of Andres' Bananas<br>

        Second click: "Menu"<br>

        Third click: Patacones<br>

        Fourth click: Extra Meat<br>

        Fifth click: Add to cart, likes that the extra options dont cost extra<br>
      Payment site: doesnt like that you need to fill in email and name, another problem with having to click the dot, instead of the image of paymentmethod <br>

        Sixth click: Check out<br>

        Payment site: Doesn't like that you need to fill in email and name <br>

        Confirmation: Doesn't need to say order will be ready, its enough with "ready for pickup" <br>
      </p>

      <h3>Anders (Windows 15inch, Google Chrome):</h3>
      <p> First impression homepage: looks well structured, and nice <br>
        instruction: order a Bandeja Paisa to Gløshaugen. <br>

        First click: Order now <br>
        Second click: Bandeja Paisa<br>
        Third: Add to cart<br>
        Fourth: Close overlay <br>
        5th: Check out <br>
        6th: Filling out info on payment site, and choosing gløshaugen as pickup point <br>
        7th: Pay now <br>

        The instruction was done without a single misclick or doubt. <br>
        Afterwards we asked him to find out where the foodtrucks were located today. <br>
        He looked over the page and quickly found the location tab, which led him directly to the correct site.
      </p>

      <h3>Pål (Iphone 12 mini, safari mobile)</h3>
      <p>
        The participant had some roblems with some of the placements of divs. It is possible to order, but is far from
        optimal.
        With further work we would optimise the page for smaller devices such as phones and tablets.

      <h2>Self-reflection</h2>
      <p>Overall we had a very good experience working on this project. We met up and worked together on mondays and
        tuesdays. When not working together, we used git-hub so that we were able to work by ourselves in different
        places. Du to our usergroup being collegestudents, we mostly tested on collegestudents. Collegestudents are
        usually good with tech and therefore we could have for example tested on elderly people as well, to ensure
        that the website is easy to use an userfriendly for several usergroups.
        We did not create a back-log for this project. This would have been nice during
        the last weeks of the project, and could have made it easier to assign tasks. 
      </p>
