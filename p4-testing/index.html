    <h1>Testing of the website</h1>

    <h2>Administrative details</h2>
    <p>The name of the fictional client is Andres Bananas, and is the sole proprietor of Andres bananas foodtruck </p>
    
    <h2>Tester audience</h2>
    <p>Seeing that our intended audience is for students studying at gløshaugen who need a little food. <br>
    we went in the corridors and asked students if they had some time to spare to test out our webpage for a food ordering system.</p>
    
    <h2>Testing platforms</h2>
    
    <p>The testing platforms depended on situation, we had published the page on folk.ntnu and gave the link to students after asking if they would be willing to test out our page. <br>
    this resulted in different operative systems(macOS and Windows) on different screensizes. The browsers were primaraly safari and google chrome in these cases. <br>
    we also brought our own laptops and asked other students to test the website on those, where we had opened the page in opera and firefox. </p>
    <p>We had brought our own laptops, so that the students wouldnt have to hassle with getting up their own. <br>
    The platforms we tested on where a windows 16.8 inch, and a macbook 13inch in different browsers like chrome, opera, firefox and safari</p>


    <h2> Physical testing with observations</h2>
     
    <h3>Brage(macOS 13inch, safari):</h3>
      <p>Deilig homepage <br>
      first click: order now<br>
      second click: hva vil han ha?
      går for billigst
      liten bug i choose extra topping<br>

      easy to choose dishes, and go to paymant<br>

      easy payment side, <br>

      confirmation page is easy to understand<br>

      checking around the rest of the page:<br>
      location page; works nice, <br>

      doesnt go to check where the locations are despite it beeing an option on the homepage
      good that it shows on the order confirmation<br>

      suggestion: could show the location on the payment side when choosing between gløshaugen or øya/kalvskinnet?
     </p>

     <h3>Gorgus (windows 16.8inch, firefox):</h3>
       <p>first impressions: good contrast on colors <br>

       first click: about, likes that you can read the history of andres bananas<br>

       second click: "menu"<br>
       
       third click: patacones<br>

       fourth click: extra Meat<br>

       fifth click: add to cart, likes that the extra options dont cost extra<br>

       sixth click: check out<br>

       payment site: doesnt like that you need to fill in email and name <br>

       confirmation: doesnt need to say order will be ready, its enough with "ready for pickup" <br>
       </p>

       <h3>Anders (windows 15inch, google chrome)</h3>
       <p> first impression homepage: looks well structured, and nice <br>
        instruction: order a Bandeja Paisa to Gløshaugen. <br>

        first click: order now <br>
        second click: Bandeja Paisa<br>
        third: add to cart<br>
        fourth: close overlay <br>
        5th: check out <br>
        6th: filling out info on payment site, and choosing gløshaugen as pickup point <br>
        7th: pay now <br>

        The instruction was done without a single misclick or doubt. <br>
        Afterwards we asked him to find out where the foodtrucks were located today <br>
        He looked over the page and quickly found the location tab, which led him directly to the correct site
      </p>

      <h3>Pål (Iphone 12 mini, safari mobile</h3>
      <p>
        problems with some of the placements of divs, it is possible to order, but is far from optimal.
        with further work we would optimise the page for smaller devices such as phones and tablets
