    <h1>Testing of the website</h1>

    <p> Brage:
      Deilig homepage <br>
      first click: order now<br>
      second click: hva vil han ha?
      går for billigst
      liten bug i choose extra topping<br>

      easy to choose dishes, and go to paymant<br>

      easy payment side, <br>

      confirmation page is easy to understand<br>

      checking around the rest of the page:<br>
      location page; works nice, <br>

      doesnt go to check where the locations are despite it beeing an option on the homepage
      good that it shows on the order confirmation<br>

      innspill: could show the location on the payment side when choosing between gløshaugen or øya/kalvskinnet?
     </p>

     <p> Gorgus:
       first impressions: good contrast on colors <br>

       first click: about, likes that you can read the history of andres bananas<br>

       second click: "menu"<br>
       
       third click: patacones<br>

       fourth click: extra Meat<br>

       fifth click: add to cart, likes that the extra options dont cost extra<br>

       sixth click: check out<br>

       payment site: doesnt like that you need to fill in email and name <br>

       confirmation: doesnt need to say order will be ready, its enough with "ready for pickup" <br>
