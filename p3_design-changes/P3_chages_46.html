    <h2>3. Fullfillments</h2>
    <p>
      Ståle made the artwork for the homepage with the bananacart, as well as making the layout of the menu.html, and the styling of the your order container, which changes depending on the width of the page, when its small, it is possible to open the entirity by hovering. <br><br>
      Pål implenented the opening and closing of overlays on menu.html with javascript, he tried to implement a close on outside click, but couldnt get it to work as the "extra topping" list was counted as an outside element. As well as coding the countdown timer on confirmation.html <br><br>
      Herman implenented the javascript for filling, removing and summing up the shopping cart, as well as the code for the displayed locations, on the different days(all days on gløshauge, alternating days on Kalvskinnet and Dragvoll). <br> <br>
      Marius implemented the rolling road and the moving "order now" button on homepage.html <br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Modularity</h2>
    <p>The modularity on this site is pretty simple, it consists of a banner stretching over 
      the top, with the different home, menu, about and location sites. Beneath this there are 
      multiple divs. A good example is the menu.html page, where there is a body, which contains 
      multiple divs, like the navbar, and menu group div, containing the different dishes 
      available. On the right side there is a your orer div, which contains the items youre 
      planning on buying. Layered above this, is the overlay which pops up if clicked on one of the menu items. </p>


      
    <h2>3. Changes made in the design</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Changed order box on menu page</li>
      <li>Changed the homepage, added an animation</li>
      <li>Added a payment site</li>
      <li>Added a choice for which cart location the user buys from on payment page</li>
      <li>Added a thumbs up on the order confirmation site</li>
      <li>When less than 1170 px the maps on "location" will not be displayed</li>
      <li>Changed the confirmation page</li>
      <li>Some alterations to the shopping cart on menu page</li>
      <li>Removed quantity in the overlay</li>
      <li>Added two different confirmation pages</li>
      <li>Perhaps not having a summary of the order on payment page</li>
      <li>Had a function on the menu.html overlay which closes the overlay on click outside, it worked but the ul inside was counted as "outside the overlay" so changed it to close only on X-click. A problem with this is beeing able to click the elements underneath, resulting in multiple open overlays, and a darkening backdrop</li>
      <li>After testing; implied the location of pickup in payment site when choosing between the two alternatives</li>
      <li>Weve changed the included
          toppings, to be free, instead of priced, due to problems with adding and summing to cart</li>
    </ol>
